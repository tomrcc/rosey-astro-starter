        ### Use an ESP


        Use an email service provider (ESP) that has been tested by third-party
        email certification services. This ensures that your emails will be
        accepted by the major ISPs. An ESP that offers multiple IP addresses, or
        one that allows you to use your own IP address if necessary. ISPs often
        block messages from unknown senders, so having your own IP address helps
        get around this issue. Adding to the end of a paragraph.


        ### Double opt-in


        Before you send out any campaign using an email marketing tool, make
        sure that you have permission from your subscribers to send them emails.
        You can do this by asking them during signup or including a checkbox in
        the subscription form asking if they’d like to receive marketing
        communications from you in the future.


        Use double opt-in when sending out marketing emails. This means that the
        recipient must have previously agreed to receive emails from you before
        they can see content in their inboxes or on their mobile devices. This
        helps prevent people from signing up for newsletters they don’t want and
        can help protect against spam complaints from users who didn’t know they
        had signed up for something in the first place.


        ### Keep your content short and sweet


        Your customers don’t want to read lengthy emails full of text, so keep
        your messages short and sweet. If you have multiple products to promote,
        break up each product offer into its own email instead of sending one
        page-long message with multiple links embedded in it. That way,
        customers can easily find what they’re looking for without having to
        scroll all over the page.


        Use images sparingly (if at all). You might be tempted to include an
        image in every email you send out, but it’s important to remember that
        images can cause problems when it comes to inbox delivery — particularly
        when they’re used incorrectly or included in bulk emails from companies
        where the receiver doesn’t know who sent them. If you’re going


        ### Tracking


        Choose a reliable ESP that allows you to track opens and clicks so you
        can figure out which types of messages work best for your audience.


        ### Send your best email


        So, remember to keep this in mind and to always know that if you are
        sending out emails related to your business, be sure to follow-up with
        customers or clients and make sure that they are getting their emails in
        a timely manner.
