Nutzen Sie Double-Opt-In beim Versenden von Marketing-E-Mails. Das bedeutet, dass der Empfänger dem Erhalt von E-Mails von Ihnen zuvor zugestimmt haben muss, bevor er Inhalte in seinem Posteingang oder auf seinen Mobilgeräten sehen kann. Dies trägt dazu bei, zu verhindern, dass sich Personen für Newsletter anmelden, die sie nicht möchten, und kann zum Schutz vor Spam-Beschwerden von Benutzern beitragen, die nicht wussten, dass sie sich überhaupt für etwas angemeldet haben.</p>\n<h3>Halten Sie Ihre Inhalte kurz und bündig</h3>\n<p>Ihre Kunden möchten keine langen E-Mails voller Text lesen, also halten Sie Ihre Nachrichten kurz und bündig. Wenn Sie mehrere Produkte bewerben möchten, teilen Sie jedes Produktangebot in eine eigene E-Mail auf, anstatt eine seitenlange Nachricht mit mehreren darin eingebetteten Links zu senden. Auf diese Weise können Kunden leicht finden, was sie suchen, ohne die ganze Seite scrollen zu müssen. Gehen Sie mit Bildern sparsam um (wenn überhaupt). Sie könnten versucht sein, in jede E-Mail, die Sie versenden, ein Bild einzufügen, aber bedenken Sie, dass Bilder bei der Zustellung in den Posteingang Probleme verursachen können – insbesondere, wenn sie falsch verwendet oder in Massen-E-Mails von Unternehmen enthalten sind, in denen sie versendet werden</p>\n"},"blog:/blog/email-delivery-tips/":{"original":"  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When you send an email campaign, you expect it to reach your readers, right?
